# Product Page - Chat with Seller Feature

## Feature Added
‚úÖ **Chat button on product detail page now functional!**

When viewing a product, users can click the "‡πÅ‡∏ä‡∏ó" (Chat) button next to the seller's name to start a conversation with that specific seller.

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User views a product detail page
2. Sees seller information card with "‡πÅ‡∏ä‡∏ó" button
3. Clicks "‡πÅ‡∏ä‡∏ó" button
4. System creates/opens chat room with that seller
5. Floating chat panel automatically opens
6. User can start messaging the seller immediately

### Technical Implementation:

#### 1. Product Detail Page (`src/app/product/[id]/page.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- Added import for `createChatRoom` from chat service
- Added state: `isStartingChat` to show loading state
- Added `handleChatWithSeller` function:
  - Checks if user is logged in
  - Creates chat room with seller
  - Dispatches custom event to open chat panel
  - Handles errors gracefully

**Button Updates:**
```tsx
<button 
  onClick={handleChatWithSeller}
  disabled={isStartingChat}
  className="rounded-full bg-emerald-50 px-4 py-2 text-sm font-medium text-emerald-700 transition hover:bg-emerald-100 flex items-center gap-2 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
>
  <MessageCircle className="h-4 w-4" />
  {isStartingChat ? '‡∏Å‡∏≥‡∏•‡∏±‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏°‡∏ï‡πà‡∏≠...' : '‡πÅ‡∏ä‡∏ó'}
</button>
```

#### 2. Header Component (`src/app/components/Header.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- Added event listener for custom `openChatWithSeller` event
- Automatically opens chat panel when event is received

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleOpenChatWithSeller = (event: CustomEvent) => {
    console.log('üì¢ Received openChatWithSeller event:', event.detail);
    setIsChatOpen(true);
  };

  window.addEventListener('openChatWithSeller', handleOpenChatWithSeller as EventListener);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('openChatWithSeller', handleOpenChatWithSeller as EventListener);
  };
}, []);
```

## User Experience

### Before:
- ‚ùå Chat button was not clickable
- ‚ùå No way to contact seller from product page
- ‚ùå Had to manually search for seller in chat

### After:
- ‚úÖ Chat button is fully functional
- ‚úÖ One-click to start conversation with seller
- ‚úÖ Automatic chat panel opening
- ‚úÖ Loading indicator while connecting
- ‚úÖ Error handling with user feedback
- ‚úÖ Login redirect if not authenticated

## Features:

1. **Authentication Check**
   - Redirects to login if user not logged in
   - Shows friendly alert message

2. **Loading State**
   - Button shows "‡∏Å‡∏≥‡∏•‡∏±‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏°‡∏ï‡πà‡∏≠..." while creating chat
   - Button disabled during process to prevent double-clicks

3. **Automatic Chat Creation**
   - Creates new chat room if doesn't exist
   - Opens existing chat room if already chatting with seller
   - Uses seller's shop name or full name

4. **Seamless UX**
   - Floating chat panel opens automatically
   - Chat is ready to use immediately
   - Smooth transition from product to chat

5. **Error Handling**
   - Catches and logs errors
   - Shows user-friendly error messages
